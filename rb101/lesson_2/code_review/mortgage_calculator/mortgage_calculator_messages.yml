  You're looking for a new home of your own!  How exciting!  Or at least,
  it should be all about the excitement of your upcoming next chapter of
  life...  But, we know how the homebuying experience can be filled with
  nervousness, stress, and perhaps even a bit of sadness and disappointment.
  Unfortunately, we don't have a magic wand to sweep away all the negative
  aspects of the homebusying experience, but we can at least provide
  you with some transparency as to how much a home purchase will cost you
  in terms that actually carry meaning in your day-to-day life.

  It's not easy trying to translate a big number with lots of zeroes at
  the end into a manageable number that helps you imagine the addition
  of a mortgage payment into your budget.  But don't worry, that's where
  we can help.  With this Mortgage Calculator, just tells us the a) Loan
  Amount, b) Annual Percentage Rate (APR), and c) Loan Duration and we
  will help you understand the impact on your monthly budget.

  Shall we get started?

amount1: "First, let's look at how much you'll need to borrow."
amount2: |
  What is your expected loan amount?  (You don't have to use the '$' sign
  when you enter the loan amount!)
valid_number: "Hmm... that doesn't look like a valid number.  Let's try again."
apr1: |
  Excellent!  Now, let's take into account the interest rate that you
  qualified for from the lender (or are looking to get from the lender,
  fingers crossed!)
apr2: |
  What annual percentage rate (APR) for the mortgage loan should we use
  to calculate the monthly payments?  (Please enter the number as a
  percentage.  You don't need to include the '%' sign!)
duration1: |
  Lastly, we need to understand the mortgage term you are looking at.
  A mortgage term is the number of years you have to pay off your mortgage.
  A mortgage can typically be as long as 30 year and as short as 10 years.
duration2: |
  In how many years would you like to have your mortgage paid off?  (Please
  enter the loan duration in years!)
