welcome: |
  MWAH-HA-HA!!!
  
  Welcome to ROPSSLI!  This is a game NOT for the faint of heart.
  Get ready to stretch your feeble mind, but first let me know who
  dares challenge me!

  Tell me your name:
valid_name: |
  You cannot hide your name from me! Let yourself be known!

  Tell me your name, seriously:
hello: "MWAH-HA-HA!!!  I welcome you,"
description: |
  My name is not of this world and you will not be able to understand it
  with your human brain, so you may simply call me "Guardian".

  I stand between you and the priceless secrets of another dimension.
  Do you believe yourself worthy of the knowledge and wisdom?  If so,
  all you have to do is beat me at my own game.

  You may have heard of a game called Rock-Paper-Scissors, and you may
  think yourself a master of the game.  BAH-HA-HA!!!  Mere child's play!
  Today, you must learn to incorporate 2 more options, "Spock" and "Lizard".

  You might be thinking, "What the heck???"  Let me explain:

  Scissors cuts Paper covers Rock crushes Lizard poisons Spock smashes
  Scissors decapitates Lizard eats Paper disproves Spock vaporizes Rock
  crushes Scissors.

  Got it?  No??  Fine.  If you need me to spell it out in even more simple
  terms...

    Rock bests both Scissors and Lizard
    Paper bests both Rock and Spock
    Scissors best both Paper and Lizard
    Lizard bests both Paper and Spock
    Spock bests both Rock and Scissors

  MWAH-HA-HA!!!  You hardly stand a chance.  But it seems you are determined
  to try.  So then, let's test your abilities and see if you are worthy
  of the enlightment that lies beyond.
continue: "Go ahead, slam that return/enter key to continue!"
get_started: |
  Ah-ha!  You must be one of those that do not easily scare.  And for that,
  You have earned a tiny bit of respect from me.  As such, I will let you
  determine how many rounds we will go before you come to your senses that
  you will never be able to pass through me.
game_length: Choose your torture level - how many rounds shall we go?
length_too_long: |
  Silly human.  I do not have the patience to see you lose that many
  times.  How about you try again?
length_no_evens: |
  Silly human.  I do not play with the possibility of a draw.  We can
  only play an odd number of rounds.  How about you try again?
length_fraction: |
  Silly human.  We are not here to split a pie into pieces.  We can only
  play a whole number of rounds.  How about you try again?
length_not_number: |
  Silly human.  When I ask you "how MANY rounds", I expect you to give me
  a proper number.  How about you try again?
length_zero: |
  Silly human.  Do you seriously think I will just let you by without
  any effort on your part?  How about you try again?
length_negative: |
  Silly human.  Negative rounds exist in my dimension, but not in the one
  we are currently in.  How about you try again?
length_one: "round it is.  Great for me since I can't waste my time on you."
length_multiple: "rounds it is.  You like to be tortured, don't you?"
instruction: |
  Remember, here are the selection options you can choose from:

    Rock  |  Paper  |  Scissors  |  Lizard  |  Spock

  You can type in the full word to make a selection, or if you feel that
  you are in a rush, feel free to type in part of the word and I'll
  understand.  Beware, "Scissors" and "Spock" both start with "S", so
  make your choice clear!
player_selection: "So, what will it be?  Let your choice be known!"
valid_choice: "Are you playing games with me?  Make a proper selection!"
scissors_spock: |
  I warned you that there are two choices that start with "S"!
  Make a proper selection!
result_player: "Somehow, you won this round.  Accidents do happen..."
result_guardian: |
  Of course, I won this round!
  MWAH-HA-HA!!!  Did you actually expect a different result??"
result_tie: "Hmm...  You are just delaying the inevitable."
challenge: "you were audacious enough to challenge me for access to a world beyond."
best_of: "Best of"
rounds: "rounds you wanted to go..."
obtain: "And having obtained a total of"
win: "wins..."
player_win: |
  Access to the dimension you shall receive.  Go forth and learn the
  secrets of the universe!"
guardian_win: |
  You should realize that you are not worthy of the secrets of the universe.
  Do not fret.  You join a great many humans who also could not get past me.
play_again: |
  The door to the dimension is now closing, but I sense a different door
  to another dimension, containing a new batch of secrets, is opening up.
  Do you want to entertain me one more time?

  Press 'Y' if you believe yourself worthy!
player_choice: "In this round, you decided on"
guardian_choice: "While I went with"
exit: |
  You've had enough, I see.  Understandable.  Should you ever feel the
  urge to challenge me again, you know where to find me.  Be gone for now.
