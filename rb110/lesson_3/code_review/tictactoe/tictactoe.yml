  HA HA HA!~

  It is good to see you again!  It is I, the one known as "Guardian".  Your
  defeat at ROPSSLI, what you may know as Rock-Paper-Scissors, has not
  deterred you from seeking out new challenges!  I commend you for that
  adventurous spirit!

  Today, you have an opportunity to unlock the constraints that have been
  placed on your feeble mind so that you can see the world for what it
  really is.  But first, remind me, what is your name?  I have an eye for
  faces, but I seem to have a mental block with names.  (Beware, I do not 
  tolerate well any jokes about the irony of this situation here...)

  Tell me your name:
valid_name: |
  I may not remember thy Earthly name, but I do possess the ability to 
  detect deception!  I am from a superior dimension, after all...

  Tell me your name, seriously:
hello: "That's right!  Now I remember.  I welcome you,"

  So, I see you are interested in bettering yourself, enhancing your mind,
  discovering more about this world.  Bravo!

  All that stands in your way is this challenge that is known in your dimension
  as Tic-Tac-Toe.  Place your mark straight across the grid, if you can, and you
  win the round.  Best me 3 times and you shall receive your enlightenment.
continue: "Go ahead, press that return/enter key to continue!"

  You know Tic-Tac-Toe to be a game with a 3x3 grid.  But did you assume that 
  things will be so simple when you come face-to-face with the Guardian?  You
  should have learned during out last encounter.

  Of course, you can play on a simple 3x3 grid, but with simplicity comes minimal
  rewards.  You want to know what's inside that sphere on top of your shoulders, 
  you have to work for it.  Today, we can change the grid size, on a sliding scale
  from 3x3 to 9x9, with the greatest reward coming from besting me on the 9x9 grid!

  For games on a grid size 6x6 and beyond, you have the option to dial-a-friend
  for help!  Never say that I do not keep up with the times.  You and a friend will
  play me 2 moves to 1 but know that your reward will be diminished due to your
  show of weakness.

  And so I win.  But what did you expect?  I am the Guardian, after all!

  The opportunity to unlock the secrets inside yourself is now coming to a
  close.  But, I seem to have some extra time on my hands.  Would you like
  another shot at enlarging that tiny brain of yours?

  Press 'Y' if you feel up to the challenge!

  You've had enough, I see.  Understandable.  Should you ever feel the 
  urge to challenge yourself, I'm certain you'll find me again.  Be gone
  for now.
