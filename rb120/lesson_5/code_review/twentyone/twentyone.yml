rules: |
  The goal of Twenty-One is to try to get as close to 21 as possible,
  without going over. If you go over 21, it's a 'bust' and you lose.

  Number cards are worth their face value and the face cards are each
  worth 10.  The ace can be worth 1 or 11.

  During your turn, 'hit' to ask for another card and 'stay' to close
  out the hand.  As you think about whether you should risk another 'hit',
  know that the dealer must 'hit' until their total is at least 17.

  Whoever has the higher total without busting wins.
